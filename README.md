Technical Task for Invosys
</h1>

## Introduction 
A technical task as part of an interview for Invosys.

My task involved building a new React Component to represent the image provided. The component will be used to integrate to an endpoint which will provide the following information:

- Daily Spend Limit (¬£100)
- Current Spend (¬£25)
- List of (up to 4 and at least 1) email addresses 
- List of (up to 4) mobile numbers
  
The component has the capability to use local storage. It should be written as a standalone component that can be easily integrated into an existing application.

I also added a "remove" button to allow users to delete email addresses and phone numbers.

The application is deployed on Vercel, and you can try the app [here](https://tech-test-expense-tracker.vercel.app/): 

### Desktop view
An alert message pops up if a user attempts to submit a phone number without adding an email.

## Technology
- [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and [React Testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) is a testing utility for testing React components. Combining them to create interactive and easily testable user interfaces.
